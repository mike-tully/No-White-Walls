        <span class="title">no white walls: decolonizing through interdependency</span> is the inaugural Yale School of Art Annual exhibition curated by graduate students: Salvador Andrade, Zoila Coc-Chang, Miguel Gaydosh, athena quispe, Mike Tully, and Amartya De. This exhibition seeks to challenge the established history of the exhibition space in Western museums and galleriesâ€”a history dominated by the white cube formula. Therefore the exhibition will focus on artworks that stand free from the walls and incorporate sonic, tactile, and/or olfactory elements. Drawing from the lineage of <span class="title">Rasquache art, the Tropicalia movement, conceptualizations of Auto-construccion, and other decolonial approaches to art making,</span> this exhibition will attempt to disrupt the legacy of an educational model influenced by the commercial expectations facing MFA students today. The curators of the exhibition aim to identify, engage, and uplift <span class="title">MFA practitioners</span> within the Tri-State area (CT, NY, NJ) that are not solely invested in producing objects intended for a particular market or economic exchange. Through this refusal to engage in a market that capitalizes on the exploitation of MFA students, the exhibition will provide <span class="title">an alternative and temporary platform to practitioners</span> that move beyond established forms of knowledge keeping and distribution.
