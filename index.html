    <div class="container">
        <span class="title">NO WHITE WALLS</span> is the inaugural Yale School of Art Annual exhibition curated by graduate students which <span class="title">seeks to engage themes of collectivity and challenge the established history of the exhibition space in Western museums and galleries</span>—a history dominated by the white cube formula<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-1.svg" alt="no white walls"> As such, this exhibition will focus on artworks that stand free from the walls and incorporate sonic, tactile, and/or olfactory elements<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-20.svg" alt="no white walls"> Drawing from the lineage of <span class="title">Rasquache art, the Tropicalia movement, Auto-construcción, and other decolonial approaches to art making,</span> this exhibition will attempt to disrupt the legacy of an educational model influenced by the commercial expectations facing MFA students today<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-2.svg" alt="no white walls"> The curators of the exhibition aim to identify, engage, and uplift <span class="title">MFA practitioners within the Northeast region</span> that are not solely invested in producing objects intended for a particular market or economic exchange<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-3.svg" alt="no white walls"> Through this refusal to engage in a market that capitalizes on the exploitation of MFA students, the exhibition will provide an alternative and temporary platform to practitioners that <span class="title">move beyond siloed forms of knowledge keeping</span><img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-36.svg" alt="no white walls">
