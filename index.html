        <span class="title">no white walls: decolonizing through interdependency</span> is the inaugural Yale School of Art Annual exhibition curated by graduate students: Salvador Andrade, Zoila Coc-Chang, Miguel Gaydosh, athena quispe, Mike Tully, and Amartya De<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-1.svg" alt="no white walls"> This exhibition seeks to challenge the established history of the exhibition space in Western museums and galleriesâ€”a history dominated by the white cube formula<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-20.svg" alt="no white walls"> Therefore the exhibition will focus on artworks that stand free from the walls and incorporate sonic, tactile, and/or olfactory elements<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-2.svg" alt="no white walls"> Drawing from the lineage of <span class="title">Rasquache art, the Tropicalia movement, conceptualizations of Auto-construccion, and other decolonial approaches to art making,</span> this exhibition will attempt to disrupt the legacy of an educational model influenced by the commercial expectations facing MFA students today<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-3.svg" alt="no white walls"> The curators of the exhibition aim to identify, engage, and uplift <span class="title">MFA students</span> within the New England area that are not solely invested in producing objects intended for a particular market or economic exchange<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-10.svg" alt="no white walls"> Through this refusal to engage in a market that capitalizes on the exploitation of MFA students, the exhibition will provide <span class="title">an alternative and temporary platform to practitioners</span> that move beyond established forms of knowledge keeping and distribution<img class="shape" src="assets/shapes/shape-28.svg" alt="no white walls">
